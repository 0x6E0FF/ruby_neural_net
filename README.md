Ruby Neural Net
---------------
An attempt at the classic handwritten caracters recognition problem using neural network and automatic learning.

This is a follow up of Michael Nielsen's [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com).
The aim is to try basic concepts of neural networks and deep learning in my mother tongue ;). 

## performance comparison
comparison of feedforward computation time on test database (10000 images):
| version        | time(s) |
| -------------- | ------- |
| python version | 1.971   |
| ruby version   | 26.189  |
| c version      | 0.811   |
